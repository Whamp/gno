# GNO vs AnythingLLM

**Verdict**: Both have MCP support. AnythingLLM is GUI-first with workspaces, agents, and multi-user for teams. GNO is CLI-first, lightweight, and privacy-focused for developers.

AnythingLLM is a full-stack RAG application with workspace isolation, no-code agent builder, and team collaboration. GNO is a local knowledge engine focused on search quality, CLI workflows, and AI agent integration.

## GNO Advantages

**Search quality**: Hybrid retrieval with BM25, vector search, RRF fusion, and cross-encoder reranking. AnythingLLM uses vector similarity only.

**Lightweight**: Single CLI binary, ~500MB RAM. No Docker, no server processes.

**CLI-first**: Script searches, pipe output, integrate with shell workflows.

**Privacy**: 100% local, no network calls, no cloud dependencies. AnythingLLM can use cloud LLMs.

**AI agent integration**: Native MCP server for Claude, Cursor, Zed, Windsurf, Codex, and 5+ more targets. Skills for Claude Code.

**Incremental indexing**: SHA-256 change detection, only re-indexes modified files.

**Multilingual**: 30+ languages with cross-lingual search via bge-m3.

## AnythingLLM Advantages

**Workspaces**: Isolated document contexts for different projects or topics. Context stays clean per workspace.

**Multi-user**: Role-based permissions, team collaboration (Docker version).

**No-code agent builder**: Create custom AI agents without programming.

**LLM flexibility**: 30+ providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, Groq. GNO is local-only.

**Vector DB choice**: Swap between LanceDB, Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, and more.

**Embeddable widget**: Drop chat into any website (Docker).

**Browser extension**: Capture content directly from web pages.

**Multimodal**: Image input support across LLM providers.

**Audio features**: Transcription, text-to-speech, speech-to-text.

## When to Choose GNO

- Developer workflows with CLI, scripts, and automation
- AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) need your docs
- Privacy is non-negotiable, everything must stay local
- You want best-in-class search quality over vector-only similarity
- Lightweight install without Docker or server management
- Solo use or small team with shared folder

```bash
# Developer workflow
gno mcp install --target cursor
gno query "how does our auth work" --json | jq

# AI agent access
gno skill install --scope user
# Now Claude Code can search your notes
```

## When to Choose AnythingLLM

- Teams need multi-user access with permissions
- Non-technical users want GUI-only experience
- You need workspace isolation between projects
- Cloud LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) are preferred over local models
- Building custom agents without code
- Embedding chat widget into your website
- Need multimodal or audio features

```bash
# Team deployment
docker pull mintplexlabs/anythingllm
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 mintplexlabs/anythingllm
# Configure workspaces, users, LLM providers in web UI
```
