  questions:
    - q: What is GNO?
      a: GNO is a local knowledge search engine that indexes your documents (Markdown, PDF, DOCX, XLSX) and lets you search them using BM25 full-text, vector similarity, or hybrid search. Everything runs locally on your machine.

    - q: How do I install GNO?
      a: >
        Install via Bun with bun install -g gno. GNO requires Bun 1.0+ as its JavaScript runtime. Run gno doctor to verify your installation.

    - q: What file formats does GNO support?
      a: GNO indexes Markdown (.md), PDF (.pdf), Microsoft Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), PowerPoint (.pptx), and plain text files.

    - q: Is my data sent to the cloud?
      a: No. GNO is 100% local and privacy-first. All indexing, embedding, and search happens on your machine. Your documents never leave your computer.

- category: Search & Querying
  questions:
    - q: What is the difference between search, vsearch, and query?
      a: >
        gno search uses BM25 keyword matching (fast, exact terms). gno vsearch uses vector similarity (semantic meaning). gno query combines both with reciprocal rank fusion for best results.

    - q: How do I get AI-generated answers?
      a: >
        Use gno ask "your question" --answer. This searches your documents and generates a cited answer using a local LLM.

    - q: Can I search specific collections only?
      a: >
        Yes, use --collection or -c flag, for example gno search "term" -c notes.

- category: Configuration
  questions:
    - q: Where is the config file located?
      a: >
        On macOS and Linux it is at ~/.config/gno/config.yaml. On Windows it is at %APPDATA%\gno\config.yaml. Run gno doctor to see your exact path.

    - q: How do I add multiple document folders?
      a: >
        Use gno collection add path --name name for each folder, then run gno update to index them all.

    - q: Can I exclude certain files or folders?
      a: >
        Yes, add them to the exclude array in your collection config, for example exclude node_modules, .git, and temporary files.

- category: AI & Models
  questions:
    - q: What LLM models does GNO use?
      a: >
        GNO uses local models via node-llama-cpp. Default presets are slim (fast), balanced, and quality. Run gno models list to see available models.

    - q: Do I need an API key?
      a: No. GNO runs entirely locally with no API keys or cloud services required.

    - q: How do I change the model?
      a: >
        Use gno models use preset then gno models pull to download. Presets are slim, balanced, or quality.

  questions:
    - q: How do I use GNO with Claude Desktop?
      a: >

    - q: What is MCP?
      a: Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for AI assistants to access external tools. GNO provides an MCP server so Claude, Cursor, and other tools can search your documents.

    - q: Can I use GNO in scripts?
      a: >
        Yes, use --json flag for machine-readable output, for example gno search "term" --json piped to jq.
